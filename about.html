            </p>I am a BTEC year 2 computer science student at Colchester Institute. I have an interest in programming languages such as Python, C++ and Javascript. I also have an interest in web development and have been able to quickly pick up CSS and HTML. I also have prior knowledge in the use and implementation of libraries such as bootstrap and JQuery.<p>
            </p>I regularly use Github to store code to access from different workstations and laptops, I use Git to clone, push and commit my code to the cloud to keep repositories synced up. This helps me keep my versions synced up and allows me to pick up from where I left off between devices.<p>
            <p>My most used language is Python, the reason for this is that I was taught Python 3.5 in secondary school, from 2014 through till 2019 when I left. While originally i wasn't interested in the language, i learnt to enjoy using it over the summer holidays between terms, while also trying to make some small games in unity using C# with the Monodevelop IDE.</p>
            </p>The reason I chose to study computer science at BTEC level was due to the fact I had just finished a year of electronic engineering at BTEC level, and while competent with soldering, circuit diagnosis and design, I wasn't as interested in electronics as I was in programming. Which led me to changing my subject to computer science, where I learnt a lot of useful fundamentals within programming within my first year which allowed me to apply my knowledge into creating projects for personal improvement<p>
